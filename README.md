# What's the point of this repo?
Honestly, I'm not sure. Everything is oddly specific.

# Okay well what is here at least?
Well, there's:
* a script that can help you be extra lazy when playing bingo
* a script that can help you download and install things without a browser
* a script for people who own a G14 and want to disable boost on their CPU
   _it is actually worth noting, this works on any system_
* a script for Project Diablo 2 updating without the official launcher
   _currently it will just update all files, local check is busted_
* a backup script for Windows servers

# You're an incredible salesman
Thanks, I'm really trying.
